# VideoBucket

VideoBucket is a full stack application build with Sinatra, Ruby, and Active Record. With VideoBucket, users can:

  - Post embedded videos as Youtube links
  - Watch the videos they posted
  - Add and edit video commentary
  - Delete posted videos

## About
VideoBucket was originally conceived as a video blog. My girlfriend and I were discussing our bucket list items and how fun it would be to record our experiences trying to cross items off the list. We live in different cities, so VideoBucket provides a place where we can share our experiences apart. That said, without user authentication, VideoBucket is now serving as a place to post your favorite videos, add comments and descriptions, edit and delete those videos, and share with friends.
